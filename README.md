# Project 1 of Statistical Machine Learning
## Classification of handwritten digit recognition   

In this project, our goal is to classify handwritten digit recognition using 3 differents methods:
* Stochastic Subgradient  
* Gaussian process classification   
* Convolutional neural network classification
